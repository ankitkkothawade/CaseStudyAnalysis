# RFM Analysis: XYZ Marketplace (Year 2020)

## Business Context

In 2020, XYZ Marketplace, an emerging e-commerce platform, embraced RFM Analysis to refine its customer targeting and enhance personalized marketing strategies. This analytical approach focuses on understanding customer behavior in terms of Recency, Frequency, and Monetization.

### Key Parameters Analyzed

1. **Recency (R):** How recently did the customer engage with XYZ Marketplace?
2. **Frequency (F):** How often does the customer make purchases on the platform?
3. **Monetization (M):** What is the monetary value of the customer's transactions?

## Implementation Process

### 1. Data Collection

Collect transactional data, including timestamps of customer interactions, purchase frequency, and the financial value of transactions.

### 2. Scoring

Assign scores to customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetization metrics. Higher scores indicate more active and valuable customers.

### 3. Segmentation

Categorize customers into distinct segments based on their RFM scores. Segments may include loyal high-spenders, occasional shoppers, and customers showing decreased engagement.

### 4. Targeted Marketing

Develop personalized marketing strategies tailored to each customer segment. This could involve special promotions for high-value customers or re-engagement campaigns for dormant users.

### 5. Continuous Analysis

Regularly review and adjust segments based on evolving customer behavior and market trends. This ensures the RFM model remains aligned with the dynamic nature of customer interactions.
